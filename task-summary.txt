Task 1: Network Port Scanning

I completed this task using Nmap and Wireshark.

Steps followed:
- Installed Nmap and identified my local IP range.
- Used the command: nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24 to scan for open ports on my local network.
- Collected data about IP addresses, open ports, and services.
- Captured the scan traffic using Wireshark for deeper analysis.
- Observed the types of packets being sent during the scan.
- Saved the scan result as a screenshot and the packet capture file for documentation.

This task helped me understand how to detect active devices and recognize exposed services using basic network reconnaissance tools.
